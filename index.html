      <p>In this project, I used data collected by FiveThirtyEight to create data visualizations for settlements paid for police misconduct in the city of Los Angeles from 2010 to 2020.</p>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
          90% of the data today was created in the past few years. Living in such a world and dealing with the dazzling data everyday can be daunting. As a journalist, I have the instinct to follow the hard data and the mindset to "analyze to get a story." However, the first project of this class gave me a rare opportunity to build a personal data set - one that captures narrative and life journey, almost like a diary - and to analyze not just to get a conclusion but also create a sense of nostalgia. <br><br>
          
I faced a lot of challenges when working on the other two projects. For example, finding data online, cleaning it and boiling it down to a graphic can be time-consuming. But I was lucky (and actually, we all are lucky) to have access to countless resources and tutorials created by others to help guide the way.
<br><br>
I am especially proud of the third project, which closely examines the settlements paid for police misconduct in Los Angeles in the last 10 years. I was able to process huge loads of data, create a scatter plot and incorporate coded tooltips for easy reference. By looking at the visualization, I was able to find patterns and create more graphics based on previous findings. 
<br><br>
          Besides, I respect and honor the data integrity and ethics. In creating the police misconduct project, I encountered the dilemma - adding all the data together and creating an aggregated interactive map showing payments by city would be an exciting project. However, I do realize that data sets collected through journalistsâ€™ FOIA requests are prone to personal bias and systematic disparities. For example, a lot of the cities changed their record-keeping system throughout the years; a city police officer might interpret the questions in a FOIA request differently from another officer. Therefore, I decided to focus only on one city and avoid apple-to-apple comparisons. Additionally, I think the second graphic in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-thats-where-the-accountability-ends/">this</a> FiveThirtyEight article is misleading for the same reason - the fact that the table can be sorted and different cities were listed together hints an arbitrary comparison that might not stand.
<br><br>
          Finally, I am proud to incorporate my second project to an <a href="https://ascjcapstone.com/terms/spring-2021/wang585/">ongoing journalism project</a> that investigates on-campus fatal overdoses. I went on and created other tables and graphics to better understand the worsening trend of drug overdose among students and seek institutional accountability.
