        <h1>Project 3: Police Misconduct Payout in Los Angeles 2010-2020</h1>
        <h2></h2>
            
        <p>In this project, I used data collected by FiveThirtyEight to create data visualizations for settlements paid for police misconduct in the city of Los Angeles from 2010 to 2020.
<br><br>
            Earlier this year, FiveThirtyEight published a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-thats-where-the-accountability-ends/">story</a> titled “Cities Spend Millions On Police Misconduct Every Year. Here’s Why It’s So Difficult to Hold Departments Accountable,” which details payouts made by different cities for police misconduct. They also uploaded the <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/police-settlements">original data</a> collected through FOIA requests sent by journalists. I sifted through the dataset and decided to focus on data from the city of Los Angeles.

        <iframe title="Los Angeles City Police Misconduct Settlements 2010-2020" aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-YbbCK" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/YbbCK/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="673" height="603"></iframe>
        <p>
            The graphic provides an overview for all the reported settlements (including claims and lawsuits) for police misconduct from 2010 to 2020. It also gives insights on the <em>payment amount, purpose, time and parties involved</em>. <br>
            *Note: data before 2016 are missing case close dates, which are all reflected as Jan. 1 in this visualization.

        <p>This graphic shows the case count and sum of payout by years. Both the case count and money involved topped in 2016, which had 112 police misconduct settlements that involved $78 million.

        <p class="3"> The third graphic shows the settlements by different allegation types. You can search in the table by key words or sort the table by the amount of money paid in each year (or in total).
